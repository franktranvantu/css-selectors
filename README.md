Combinators give us the flexibility of targeting any siblings of an element. 

We can use the greater-than sign (>), plus sign (+), or tilde symbol (~) to make our selectors more specific.

- ">" targets all the direct children of an element
- "+" targets immediate siblings
- "~" targets all specified siblings that follow an element
